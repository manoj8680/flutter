# flutter-openMessaging

This is designed as an example only for using a Flutter Mobile App as the client for the firebase BaaS  in openMessaging for Genesys Cloud [OpenMessaging](https://developer.genesys.cloud/commdigital/digital/openmessaging/). This repo is the client side of the Middleware and there is another repo I have created that is the server side written as a Firebase/JavaScript project. This example requires you to have experience with firebase & Flutter. Before starting this project I recommend doing the server side of the middleware that can be found [here](https://github.com/mcphee11/firebase-openMessaging)

## 1. Flutter & Firebase setup

First of all ensure you have Flutter installed and setup as well as android studio for the emulator. This example will not go through these steps, details of this can be found at the Flutter website. You will also be using the Firebase project setup that was done in the last project with the server side elements.

The Over view design on this is below and this is focused on the mobile app side of the design.

## 2. Firebase Authentication

Ensure that in the Firebase you have Google setup as the "provider" for authentication as that is what this Flutter example application is using. You can use a different provider but in that case you will need to update the Dart code to reflect this change.

## 3. Firebase Firestore

In the Firebase firestore create a "collection" called 

    users

The other "documents" you can see below get automaticlly created as users authenticate with the App as well as start to send messages. Using the Firestore enables you to control the history cache that loads to allow for much more threading time then the max 72hours as well as from a data loading and offline viewing it has been designed by firebase to scale as well as allowing for multiply clients to "subscribe" to changes without needing to use websockets. This is all handeled by the firebase SDK and saves a LOT of pain in building this at scale.

In the "Rules" for the database ensure you set the below options to ensure that it is secured. The below will only allow someone who has a valid token and only access to the users messages based on their UUID.

    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
    match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /users/{userId}/messages/{document=**} {
        allow read, write: if
            request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
        }
        match /users/{userId}/profile/{document=**} {
            allow read, write: if
                request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
        }
    }
    }

## 4. Firebase Storage

If you want to allow images to be sent by the Mobile App you will need to allow a storage location for the attachments. For this I'm using the Girestore Storage which is a GCP Bucket under the hood. When you create a folder ensure its called

    uploads/

on the root dir. This is what the App will look for in the design. For the "Rules" ensure that you have the below configured.

    rules_version = '2';
    service firebase.storage {
    match /b/{bucket}/o {
        match /{allPaths=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
    }
    }

## 5. Firebase Functions

You should notice that there are already 2x Clound Functions in your Firebase project (as long as you went through the server side project first).

As these are deployed in the same project they are seen as a trusted server side function so the Auth is taken care of for you in GCP/Firebase.

## 6. Firebase Cloud Messaging

Make sure that you have enabled and configured firebase cloud messaging to get the push notifications even when the app is closed. For this the API (V1) is used.

## 7. Project Settings

Create a "Flutter" App... This will step you through the process of adding and creating the apps you require including Android, ios and Web. As you have alread created the app you wont need to do ALL the steps, you will need to do the below.

![](/docs/images/flutterApp.png?raw=true)

first open the terminal and move into the flutter folder eg

    cd open_messaging

From here insure you are logged into the flutter account that you have already setup in the server build.

    firebase login

You dont need to create the flutter project as its already created. So next ensure you ahve the flutterfire_cli installed

    dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

Then configure the project your using. If the Firebase Web UI it will give you your project name if you dont have it you can enter the belwo then select the project name in firbase your using.

    flutterfire configure

Now use the space bar to select the Apps you want to create eg Android & web. If you want iso include this as well. This will then create a "lib/firebase_options.dart" file which will have OS config information. I have already put this in the gitignore file, as well as the ios runner files that get created and the google-services.json fiel that will auto import as well which is a much more automated process then it was previously. 

Once the Apps are created go into the the Android App and ensure you create both a SHA1 & SHA256 key. NOTE if your moving to a new Developer env you will also need to add this new device codes. To generate these information can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth). These steps may change over time so pease also do follow the firebase UI steps.

    google-services.json

![](/docs/images/projectapps.png?raw=true)

File will now auto import with new process no need to download and import.

## 8. Flutter App

Now you can run a build on the Android APK and run the App.

Notifications:

You can recieve notifications even when the app is fully closed.

## 9. Agent Restart

I have not included this code but you can have a Cloud Function that will operate as the "Agentless Message" API to allow you to build out a simple Agent based UI to allow the agent to "restart" the conversation once its disconnected rather then waiting for the customer to reply with the Mobile App.

![](/docs/images/agentpush.png?raw=true)

This is an easy extension of the above example and if there is a requirement I may add that example code into another repo in the future.

# Flutter Web Build

To build this app as a Flutter for Web application I have updated the required packages as well as the index.html file in the /open_messaging/web/ dir. In this file you will notice that the firebase CDNs are now listed as well as a new file called:

    firebaseconfig.js

You will need to create this file and host it in the root Dir of the Flutter for web project once its built. To build the file simply go to your Firebase project and get the CDN configuration,

![](/docs/images/htmlapp.png?raw=true)

From this you can copy the firebaseConfig JSON object with the settings from your project. Use this to create the "firebaseconfig.js" file:

    var firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEP",
        authDomain: "YOUR_DOMAIN",
        databaseURL: "YOUR_URL",
        projectId: "YOUR_PROJECTID",
        storageBucket: "YOUR_BUCKET",
        messagingSenderId: "YOURID",
        appId: "YOUR_APPID",
        measurementId: "YOUR_MEASURMENTID"
    };

    firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

Save this and once you have ran the command to build the web app

    Flutter build web

In the /build/web/ location save this new config js file and now when you run the index.html file it will load all your settings. Where ever you host this website build you will need to ensure that you also have that domain allowed in the OAuth provider you have used in this example that is Google in the Firebase Auth providers.
